This is my awesome project
========

Every project has a README nowadays, right?
Read Me Driven Development - one might also call it.

Well Don Knuth invented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate Programming</a> some time back.

This readme file is actually also the build definition, for Jenkins - a literate build file!
Never again will your README be lies - it has to work - it is your build definition!

Firstly, we can optionall define the environments on which this runs:


# Environments

* `java`
    - `oraclejdk7`
        * `linux`, `x86`
    - `openjdk6`
        * `linux`, `x64`



  We may want to do this for a whole matrix of OSes and JVMs, in this case (or maybe not defaults are fine - you can leave it out if you don't care).

# Build

  We can refer to one of the environments above (in case your build is different on different OSes!) - or use the default, as always.

* On `java`

  First we run the tests, maybe setup some dependencies

        mvn test

    OK, if we have made it this far, we can run the build

        mvn package

    worth noting that these are really just commands - they could call scripts in your project if you like

        ./bin/ci-cleanup



# multiple *branches*

  This all works because each branch we want to build has a `.cloudbees.md` marker file - saying that you want to build this branch.
  You can put this in the marker file you want - or the README.md - doesn't matter.
